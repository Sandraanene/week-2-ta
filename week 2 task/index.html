           <ul>
            <li> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a web page by using a system of tags and elements. These tags define different elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more, allowing web browsers to interpret and display the content correctly to users.</li>
           </ul>
           <li> What is HTML used for?</li>
           <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is primarily used for creating and structuring the content of web pages on the internet. Here are some of the key purposes and uses of HTML:</p>
           <ul>
            <li>Content Structure: HTML provides a structured way to organize the content of a web page, including text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements. It uses elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, and divs to define the layout and hierarchy of information.</li>
            <li>Hyperlinking: HTML allows you to create hyperlinks, or clickable elements, that connect different web pages together. Hyperlinks enable users to navigate between pages on the same website or link to external websites, resources, or documents.</li>
            <li>Accessibility: HTML provides features and attributes that help improve accessibility for users with disabilities, such as screen readers. Semantic markup, alternative text for images (alt attribute), and other accessibility features ensure that web content is perceivable, operable, and understandable to all users.</li>
           </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>
            <h4> Main Questions</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements? </li>
                <p>Normal HTML elements focus on structural layout, while semantic HTML elements convey meaning and context, aiding accessibility and search engine optimization.</p>
           <li>Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML</li> 
           <p>Closing tags are used to mark the end of an HTML element, ensuring proper structure and hierarchy. Self-closing tags, however, are used for elements that don't contain content or need a closing counterpart, like line breaks or images.</p>
           <li>What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML very short </li>
           <p>Inline elements flow within the text and do not break the flow, while block elements create separate blocks on the page, typically with line breaks before and after.</p>
        </ul>
